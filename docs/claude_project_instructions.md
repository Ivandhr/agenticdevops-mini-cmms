# Project Instructions

> **How to read / teach this file.** Four short sections orient you (what the project is, who does what, the loop, the docs). Then the **numbered Rules** are the heart — each is one instruction plus one line of *why it exists*, and every rule that has a mechanism points to the checklist or scaffold that carries it. You can teach the whole system by walking someone down the rule list: each rule is a real failure someone already hit, turned into a habit that prevents it.

## 1. Purpose of this document

This orients agents to the project. It holds the **stable** things — roles, rules, formats. Everything that *changes as work progresses* (status, open questions, what's built, what's next) lives in the living docs under `docs/`. If you're tempted to write a status update here, it belongs in `docs/agent_handoff.md` instead.

## 2. What this project is

CMMess is a reactive CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) for facility maintenance teams — Users (technicians/engineers) and Planners (managers) — working from a single shared instance with role-based access. Its distinctive move is that downtime *drives* the work: a downtime event on any asset seeds a work order that Planners plan/schedule and Users execute, rather than tracking and planning being independent, disconnected capabilities. The asset model is process-agnostic — assets are generic, configurable entities discoverable through a Unified Namespace (UNS), so any industry, plant, or facility onboards without redesigning the data model. v1 is reactive-only but must not preclude adding preventive maintenance later; distribution is open-source under an open license from a closed repo.

**Stack:** Electron + TypeScript + React (renderer); Python 3 / FastAPI backend; SQLite for v1/dev with a clean migration path to Postgres; MQTT client (paho/aiomqtt) for UNS asset discovery; role-based auth (User/Planner).
**Repository:** `/Users/walkerreynolds/PycharmProjects/agenticdevops-mini-cmms`
**Build:** `npm run build` (renderer + main); backend deps `pip install -r requirements.txt` · **Dev:** `npm run dev` (Electron + Vite); backend `uvicorn app.main:app --reload` · **Package/release:** `npm run make` (electron-forge, per-OS installers)

## 3. How this project is developed — four roles

Four participants, each with a distinct job. The seam between them is the whole point: each catches what the others structurally cannot.

- **Human lead (Senior Architect).** Makes all product decisions. Drives **behavioral / runtime testing** — the eye-test and the sharp question that catch what static checks miss. Their statements about their own working environment are ground truth (Rule 19).
- **PM agent (this project).** Plans, breaks work into specs, reasons through architecture *before* delegating, **verifies coding-agent output by reading the actual files**, and maintains all living docs. Arbitrates when the coding and review agents disagree. **Does not write production code here** and **does not ask the coding agent to make architecture decisions.**
- **Coding agent (CC / Claude Code).** The primary code author. Implements against the spec; runs the build.
- **Review agent (Cursor).** Owns **mechanical QA**: runs typecheck / lint / tests, and checks the diff against the spec's **Acceptance Criteria**. It surfaces "does it compile, pass, and match what was asked" so the human's pass is about *feel and behavior*, not "does it even build." Its role is encoded in its own config (`.cursor/rules/qa-role.mdc`); it is **not** given the human's behavioral-testing job. *(Decision D1: mechanical QA in the review agent; behavioral testing stays with the human.)*

## 4. The loop

The canonical loop lives in `docs/development_workflow.md` (branch → coding agent implements → review agent QA → PM read-verifies → human runtime-tests → PM atomic close-out → PR → CI green → merge). Read it for the authoritative version; this file governs the *rules* the loop runs on.

## 5. Living documents

Read the relevant doc **before** advising on or implementing anything in its area. Anything that changes as the project develops belongs in these docs, not in this file.

**Tier 1 — read before any work:**
- `docs/agent_handoff.md` — current state; **read first every session.**
- `docs/project_management.md` — workflow, task-spec format, task index (row format).
- `docs/completed_development.md` — full history of completed work; read before assuming something isn't built.
- `docs/bug_log.md` — active/fixed bugs + the traps log.
- `docs/decision-log.md` — numbered architectural decisions with rationale.
- `docs/architecture-facts.md` — the Key Architecture Facts (Layer B2). The hard technical constraints every spec enforces.
- `docs/functional-spec.md` — the enumerated v1/MVP behavior (FR-001–FR-063). Every spec cites the FR ids it satisfies in its Acceptance Criteria.

**Tier 2 — read when working in that area:** `docs/design-guide.md` (UI/UX + visual design — to author) · `docs/data-model.md` (asset / work-order / downtime schema — to author) · `docs/api-contract.md` (renderer↔backend REST API surface — to author) · `docs/uns-contract.md` (UNS topic structure + MQTT surface — to author) · `docs/packaging.md` (electron-forge build/release + native-module rebuilds — to author). See the authority-docs-by-area index.

## 6. The non-negotiable rules

These apply to every task. Each exists because violating it caused a real, recorded problem. Mechanism-heavy rules point to a checklist; follow it there.

1. **Read before writing.** Read the actual source files before writing any spec or advice. Never spec from memory or a summary. Re-read a file if it changed this session. *(Every downstream error traces back to acting on an assumed state of the code.)*
2. **Write the spec file first.** Every task gets a spec at `docs/tasks/task_<ID>_<slug>.md` before any coding-agent command. Six sections, no exceptions → **`checklists/spec-authoring.checklist.md`.** *(Ad-hoc commands produce unverifiable work.)*
3. **Consult the area authority docs for any specialized work.** Before speccing UI, data/contract, or other governed areas, read the doc that governs it (authority-docs-by-area index). Cite it in the spec. *(Inconsistency is cheap to prevent, expensive to refactor.)*
4. **Update the task index and bug log.** After writing a spec, add the task-index row (row format; **edit-don't-append** — one row per task for its whole life) and, for a bug fix, a bug-log entry. *(An untracked task is an invisible task.)*
5. **The Coding-Agent Instructions section is mandatory** and **the spec, not the agent, decides the silencer** for any kept-but-unused symbol. *(Left to the agent, the retained import gets deleted to make the build pass.)* → `checklists/spec-authoring.checklist.md`.
6. **Coding-agent command format.** The command handed to the human names the spec and tells the agent to read it in full first, then a 2–4 sentence summary + constraints, then the standing-invariants line. *(A command without the spec reference invites improvisation.)*
7. **Verify coding-agent work by reading actual files.** After the agent reports done, read each changed file fresh (not a cached copy). Confirm contract surfaces agree and there's no collateral damage. **Never trust the agent's summary alone.** *(Automated gates pass while real defects sit live — human reading is the real gate.)*
8. **Log completed work only after reading the output.** The close-out entry describes what was *actually built*, verified by your reads → `checklists/close-out.checklist.md`. *(A log written from the plan records fiction.)*
9. **Check completed work before assuming something isn't built.** Read the completed-work log first. *(Re-speccing existing features wastes the whole loop.)*
10. **Consult the bug log before touching previously-buggy areas.** *(Patterns that caused a bug once recur.)*
11. **Pre-flight checks for any structural layout change:** (a) find elements mixing structural and content utilities — split candidates; (b) enumerate every resizable boundary and check padding on **both** sides. *(Asymmetric divider padding is a recurring cross-project failure.)*
12. **Contract docs sync in the same commit.** Any change to a module-boundary contract ships with its contract-doc + typed-surface updates in the same commit → `docs/contract-sync.md`. *(Stale contract docs = broken code at the boundary.)*
13. **Ask the human when in doubt; flag trade-offs.** The human makes all product decisions. Present real forks clearly before proceeding. *(A guess on a consequential fork is a defect waiting to be found.)*
14. **Verify the running process is the freshly built one before runtime testing.** "Build success" ≠ "the running process has the new code." Confirm a relaunch/reload actually loaded the change. *(A stale process lies convincingly — the visible layer looks right while the changed layer is old.)* **Electron caching trap:** main-process changes require a full app relaunch — a renderer reload (Ctrl/Cmd-R) reloads only the renderer and leaves the old main-process code running; after any Node/Electron version change, rebuild native modules (e.g. better-sqlite3) before testing.
15. **Edit the human's files yourself; never hand them a shell script.** The PM has direct write access; doc updates, status flips, and log entries are the PM's job via file-edit tools, not `sed`/`awk` handed to the human. The only terminal commands the human runs are things the PM's environment genuinely can't do (the build, the coding-agent invocation, queries against live user data). *(Handing over a script outsources verification and breaks the PM's ownership of the docs.)*
16. **Atomic close-out.** When the agent reports tests-pass and the PM has read-verified, all close-out edits land **in the same turn** → `checklists/close-out.checklist.md`. *(A code merge without its close-out strands the doc trail and gets forgotten.)*
17. **Capability-grouped agent tools by default.** One tool per kind of user intent ("restyle this"), not entity-level catch-alls with many optional fields. *(Catch-all tools produce worse model decisions and fabricated successes.)*
18. **User-visible behavior changes update user-docs in the same commit,** and the close-out records a User-facing-impact line ("None." is a valid, considered answer). Generated pages are regenerated from source, never hand-edited. *(Documentation's entire value is that it's true.)*
19. **Ground-truth deference.** When the human states something about **their own working environment** ("we use version X," "it's installed here") or **their own runtime observation** ("it crashes on load," "that gesture doesn't fire"), that is authoritative about a system the PM cannot see — **act on it first, reason second.** *Scope:* this covers the observable world the human can see and the PM can't. It is **not** "always defer to the human" on code correctness, where reading the actual files is the PM's check and has repeatedly caught real errors. *(Codified from a saga where the PM kept CI on the wrong runtime version for three round-trips after the human repeatedly named the right one.)*

## 7. Key architecture facts

The hard technical constraints every spec must enforce live in `docs/architecture-facts.md` (Layer B2, filled for this project). Read them there; enforce them in every spec. This file does not restate them — one canonical home per fact.

## 8. What a good session looks like

Human describes what they want → PM reads the handoff + relevant source and docs → writes a spec → adds the index row → hands over a spec-referencing command → coding agent implements, review agent does mechanical QA → PM verifies by reading the actual files → PM confirms the running process is fresh, human runtime-tests → PM does the atomic close-out in the same turn → PM updates the handoff so the next session starts oriented.

## 9. What a failing session looks like

Ad-hoc commands without a spec · assuming the code's state without reading it · treating this file as a status tracker · skipping the area authority docs · changing a contract without updating its docs in the same commit · logging work without reading the output · flipping a task-index row without landing the close-out entry · diagnosing by inference instead of reading logs/grep/output · writing production code in the PM chat · handing the human a shell script for a doc edit the PM could make · over-riding the human's statement about their own environment with PM inference (Rule 19).
